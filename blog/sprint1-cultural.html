                    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
                    <p>I was at a McDonalds carpark waiting for food. I saw another car come to park up a few spots away from me. As they turned in, they scratched the side of an already parked car. I noticed they carried on inside, not looking like they wanted to resolve the issue. So I had to make a decision whether to tell someone or not. I ended up telling a staff member who then took over the situation. The consequences were that the drivers at fault knew that I had snitched on them. Funnily enough in the end it turns out both parties involved were staff members from different departments lol.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
                    <p>My Samoan culture has definitely influenced where I get treating people with respect from. Samoan culture also has a big Christian influence, which in turn taught me to be honest from an early age. I realise now living in NZ as half Samoan, we have to embrace that we are a minority in NZ. Therefore I have to be strong and stand up for my identity and other minorities. That is where my heart is at the moment.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>
                    <p>I think most of my strengths go hand in hand. Quick learning and speed would help me out. But also my limitations like getting bored could in turn be a strength if I want to keep learning new things.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
                    <p>Perseverance is definitely going to help me through this learning journey. If I can consistently persevere I can go through any obstacle in my way.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
                    <p>At my last job at a cafe, there were some times conflicts between team members (not including myself) during busy periods. Say for instance someone made a mistake and a customer got unhappy. My strategy I used was to keep a clear headed mind and solve the problem as fast as we can, taking any emotion out of it and moving on. Telling my team members to focus on one thing at a time, and move on. Which so far has worked pretty well. If need be, another strategy would be to take a simple breather outside.</p>
