                    <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
                    <p>Lets take an example of your room in your house. HTML sets the structure of your room; how many walls, windows, doors. Also what furniture.</p>
                    <p>CSS helps you choose the styling/design of your room. For instance the colour of the walls, colours of lights, the placement of furniture and how far away your bed is in comparison to other walls.</p>
                    <p>Javascript makes your room functional. It can turn on your light when you choose to, open cupboard & drawers etc.</p>

                    <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>
                    <p>Let’s say the example is ‘washing dishes’. The control flow would state the steps in an order. </p>
                    <p>First fill sink up with water, next add dish soap to water, next grab item from dirty stack, clean item in sink, place item on rack.</p>
                    <p>Now a loop would for instance be repeating a chosen step, before moving onto another step. So the loop would be ‘next grab item from dirty stack, clean item in sink, place item on rack’ until there is nothing in dirty stack.</p>

                    <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
                    <p>The DOM is like a family tree of all elements within your project. All elements are structured in an orderly fashion. Using specific commands you can point to an exact element and modify it straight from the DOM. For an example you can change the Title Heading to colour red.</p>

                    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                    <p>To access an array you have to input using the index/numbers. Whereas with objects you can be specific using strings and/or integers.</p>

                    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                    <p>If we go back to the ‘washing dishes’ example. Every time you have to wash dishes, you don’t want to have to declare all the steps you need to take, one after the other, day in, day out. So to save time you could create a function. You would need to input all the steps needed just once, and then name the function ‘Wash Dishes’. The function will save all the steps in memory. So next time all you need to do is call the function ‘Wash Dishes’ and all the steps will follow through. Oh did I also mention you were a robot? I should have mentioned that at the start hehe</p>
