                    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
                    <p>Software developer/engineer. Maybe along the lines of working with machines or AI? Would love to work for either of Elon Musks companies: Tesla, SpaceX & Neuralink. Or AI Soul Machines in Auckland!</p>

                    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
                    <p>How to work in a collaborative/team environment within the IT industry. How does a team of coders work together? Getting over challenges with coworkers. Time Management, creating plans, and most importantly sticking to them.</p>

                    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h3>
                    <p>Own strengths: positive attitude, easy going, high standards. Limitations: High Standards, time management</p>

                    <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
                    <p>The big thing for me would be to make a commitment to time management. Sticking to plans made by myself or others. I would start by planning my week ahead on a Sunday. I will also dedicate and create a space for myself in a room at home to focus with no distractions.</p>

                    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
                    <p>I can commit myself to asking any questions to the slack group chat, before searching online.</p>

                    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
                    <p>To support and understand my learning journey. Be able to answer all my questions, even if it means to direct me to someone who can.</p>

                    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h3>
                    <p>Block-out times would be definitely from 5pm every night for family-time.</p>
