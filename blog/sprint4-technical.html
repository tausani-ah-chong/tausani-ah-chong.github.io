        <h1>Story-Time</h1>

        <h3>When I got blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
        <p>
          There was one point I remember I got stuck during kata. The excercise was JS Gradebook.
          In the excerise you were given data which included student names and separately their
          scores/grades. What you had to do, was use your knowledge of Javascript to manipulate
          the given data, and add to a gradebook. The gradebook has to be a separate object
          or group of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got stuck on the first few tasks, and I realised because I started too complex.
          I tried to find the most effective way to write the program, with the least amount 
          of code. Ended up using up too much time. Which made me feel so frustrated.
          So I back-tracked and started again keeping it simple, solving through the error
          messages. I learned that it was better to make the program work first, and then
          refactor afterwards.
        </p>

        <h3>When I solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
        <p>
          This excercise was the very last kata exercise involing 'Built-in Methods'. The
          function I had to write was called 'deBee'. I felt like because it was the 
          last one, I had built up enough momentum, and confidence through practice. Enough
          so, that my Pseudocode felt more natural, as I knew all the steps that I needed
          to take. Even if I didn't know what methods to use. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This made me feel very capable and I feel like all these hours of hard work and
          practice was worth it. I learned that through practice, and doing something
          every day brings confidence in myself and my abilities.
        </p>

        <h1>My confidence with different problem solving techniques</h1>

        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
          Feel very capable and confident. My go-to.
        </p>
          
        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>
          It 'gets the ball rolling' or 'gets the party started' up to you hehe
        </p>

        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
        <p>
          To be honest I haven't tried this out yet. Still nervous to do when around others
          lol (I study in a shared space.)
        </p>

        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
          Very helpful. Its a good start to point me in the right direction.
        </p>

        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, this is basicly my eyes. This is where I get to experiment.
        </p>

        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
          Love it.... if you know what you're looking for.
        </p>

        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>
          It will get easier once I meet everyone in person.
        </p>

        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
        <p>
          Feel more confident now, after a few video calls.
        </p>

        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I'm just going to trust this process. I mean I haven't been actively thinking
          if improving my reflections process helps or not. But I feel like it helps.
        </p>
