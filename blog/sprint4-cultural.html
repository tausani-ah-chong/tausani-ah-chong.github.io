                    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

                    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
                    <p>Pretty much if you were told about how you can train your Brain like a muscle and that the more that you work on that one subject, the faster and stronger your brain works for that specific thing. It would bring great confidence in those people who know. Knowing about Neuroplasticity is basically knowing about your brains strengths.</p>

                    <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h3>
                    <p>Basically practice, practice & more practice. Dedicating a small chunk of time at least everyday to practice.</p>

                    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity.</h3>
                    <p>Practicing, making your content/subject relevant to your life, also knowing what you can do with Neuroplasticity can increase it.</p>

                    <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

                    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>

                    <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
                    <p>It is a open way of thinking. Knowing that everything can be learned, through dedication and time. It creates a positive outlook and attitude towards learning. It is relevant with anything that is new to you. Because you will make mistakes and be challenged. Having a growth mindset helps you push through. Especially with learning how to code, there is a steep learning curve.</p>

                    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                    <p>It made me wonder and think about ‘talents’, and ‘gifts’. I guess also reaffirming the the phrase “Hard work, beats talent”. Realising both talent and hard work are the same thing in a way. </p>

                    <h3>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                    <p>Very easily. Honestly I think for me, from now on I will always have a growth mindset. I will integrate by having a positive attitude, and being brave knowing that I don’t know everything just yet. Persevering through challenge and blocks. Knowing that I will fail a lot, in turn will help me learn and grow.</p>
