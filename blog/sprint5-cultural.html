        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I have learned that I have to work at it everyday, I also learnt that I do shy away from hard
          challenges and get distracted. Through practice I do improve.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Values - Know yourself and where you came from.</li>
          <li>Empathy - Very very important for working in a team environment.</li>
          <li>Self awareness - Being kind to yourself, looking after yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Knowing that core values can actually relate and be practiced in all areas of your life, not
          just programming.
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p>
          I think exploring myself, and also constructing a learning plan.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          Because it it the most important aspect not just for programming but for life. And it
          is one employers favour the most.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          No way. Im grateful that both technical and core values are taught. I think I wouldn’t have
          known otherwise how important it is.
        </p>

        <h1>Preparing for Bootcamp</h1>

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          Big, big goal is still to be able to be apart of a big organisation that is dealing with new
          technology, advancing human race. i.e. SpaceX, Apple, Google. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In all honesty I still find this question so tough to answer, because I don’t know what is out
          there, I don’t have much knowledge about the career path in IT/programming. I would still love
          to learn more on a job. I would still love to be of service to the human race as a whole, and my
          heart is also with wanting to help my fellow P.I.’s (Pacific Islanders) through apps, and new technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So I guess I would like to go down the path of becoming a confident app developer. Destinations I still
          need to research but I know of ‘Soul Machines’ based in Auckland. 
        </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          Biggest strengths would still be the same, positive attitude. Limitations will be starting my new
          daily habits that I want. Once I start I feel more focused during the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that with a plan, and sticking to it, I am more productive. I just have to jump back on the wagon,
          and be kind to myself, if I fall off. Which will definitely help during bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>
          Staying focused and sticking to a game plan.
        </p>

        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        <p>
          Definitely improving leadership skills. Improving reflective skills. Creating good healthy learning habits,
          like planning day out, meditation. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          My commitment will be to stay on top of workload by, putting in extra hours after class, at least an
          extra hour at night and more on weekends. Planning my day or week ahead. Reaching out to facilitators
          for the best way to manage workload. Not to distract others while in a learning environment. But helping
          to ask answer questions also.
